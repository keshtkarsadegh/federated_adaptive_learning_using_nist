Sequential aggregation strategies for federated learning.

This module implements sequential (one-by-one) update rules where each
client update is integrated into the global model in order of arrival.
Two categories are provided:

- Weight-based updates (SequentialWeightsAGGMETHODS):
    * seq_fixed_ratio_update        : fixed 70/30 global-client blend
    * seq_equal_update              : equal incremental averaging (α = 1/(i+1))
    * seq_fedavg_update             : weighted by client sample proportion
    * seq_incremental_update        : progressive weighting based on index

- Delta-based updates (SequentialDeltaAGGMETHODS):
    * seq_delta_fedavg_update       : FedAvg using deltas weighted by sample proportion
    * seq_delta_scaled              : deltas scaled equally by 1/K
    * seq_delta_capped              : deltas capped at 1/K to prevent domination
    * seq_delta_progressive_update  : progressive deltas with α increasing over time

These methods support keyword arguments such as:
    - index: position of the client in sequential order (int)
    - num_clients: total number of clients (int)
    - client_sample_count: number of samples for this client (int)
    - all_clients_samples: total samples across all clients (int)

They are grouped into containers (SequentialWeightsAGGMETHODS and
SequentialDeltaAGGMETHODS) for easy iteration and discovery.
